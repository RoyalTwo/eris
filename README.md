## What is this?
This is my latest iteration of a custom messaging platform designed to be similar to Discord / Slack. Currently, I'm working on the next iteration, utilizing all of the things I learned while making this one; however, the basics on this one are still fully functional!

Features: 

*    Custom authentication system
*    Persistent messaging between users
*    Accepting / denying Direct Message requests
*    Secure information storage

#### Using:
> **NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, JavaScript**

## Why?
Ideally, to customize a messaging platform to my specifications!
I've always felt current messaging platforms tend to be semi-bloated or have poor UX. Eventually,
this will hopefully be a way for me to try out my own versions.

Plus, I had wanted to make a full stack web application for quite a while,
and this was a perfect use case! I learned quite a lot from this one about routing, 
client side handling combined with server side, etc; so much so I wanted to try 
again from the ground up, which is what I'm currently working on.

Also, as always, it was really fun! 🙂

### How To Host
Make sure you have a Mongo database beforehand!
- Clone the repo, and rename ".env-example" to ".env"
- In .env, paste the following:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URL=""
    SECRET=""
    ```
- Put your values into the quotes.
- Run `npm run server`
- That's it! Your instance is live on port 4105 by default.
